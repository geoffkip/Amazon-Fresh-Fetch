## 🏗️ Architecture

This project uses **LangGraph** to orchestrate a multi-step workflow:

```
User Input → Planner → Extractor → Shopper → Human Review → Checkout
```

### Workflow Nodes

1. **Planner Node**: 
   - Analyzes user meal preferences using Google Gemini 2.5 Pro AI
   - Generates a structured weekly meal plan with breakfast, lunch, and dinner
   - Includes detailed ingredients with quantities (lbs, oz, cups, count)
   - Calculates daily nutritional information (calories, protein, carbs, fat)
   - Uses higher temperature (0.7) for creative meal planning

2. **Extractor Node**: 
   - Parses meal plan JSON to extract all ingredients using Google Gemini 2.5 Pro
   - Consolidates duplicate items by summing quantities
   - Filters out pantry items that the user already has
   - **Preference Learning**: Analyzes past shopping history to learn brand preferences
   - Automatically upgrades generic items (e.g., "Peanut Butter") to specific brands you've bought before (e.g., "Smuckers Peanut Butter")
   - Returns a clean, deduplicated shopping list with improved text cleaning

3. **Shopper Node**: 
   - Searches Amazon Fresh for each item
   - Scrapes top 3 search results with titles and prices
   - Uses Google Gemini 2.5 Flash to intelligently select the best match/value from options
   - **Smart Fallback**: If AI selection fails, automatically retries with brute-force first-result method
   - Adds selected items to cart with real-time budget tracking
   - Handles missing items and budget cutoffs gracefully
   - Automatically navigates to checkout when complete

4. **Human Review Node**: 
   - Pauses workflow for user to review and edit shopping list
   - Allows manual item removal/addition before shopping begins
   - Provides PDF download option for meal plan

5. **Checkout Node**: 
   - Navigates to Amazon cart
   - Attempts multiple checkout button strategies (Fresh Cart, Proceed to checkout, etc.)
   - Displays comprehensive review with success rate metrics
   - Shows separate columns for successfully added items vs. missed items
   - Handles checkout initiation, then terminates for manual user completion

5. **Install Playwright browsers**
   ```bash
   playwright install chromium
   ```
   
   Note: The first time you run the app, you'll need to manually log in to Amazon in the browser window that opens. Your session will be saved for future runs.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Your Google Gemini API key | Yes |

### Budget Limits

Set your weekly budget in the Streamlit sidebar. The agent will stop adding items once the budget is reached.

### Pantry Management

List items you already have in your pantry. The agent will exclude these from the shopping list.

### Preference Learning

The agent automatically learns from your shopping history stored in the database. When you request a generic item (e.g., "Peanut Butter"), it will suggest the specific brand you've purchased before (e.g., "Smuckers Natural Peanut Butter"). This preference learning improves over time as you create more meal plans.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Browser Not Launching
- Ensure Playwright browsers are installed: `playwright install chromium`
- Check that Chrome/Chromium is available on your system

### Login Issues
- The browser will pause for manual login on first run
- Session is saved to `amazon_session.json` for future runs
- Delete the session file to force re-login

### Items Not Found
- The agent uses AI to select the best match from search results
- If AI selection fails, it automatically falls back to adding the first search result
- Items that can't be matched or exceed budget appear in the "Missing/Skipped" section
- You can manually add items in the browser window if needed

### Database Issues
- The SQLite database (`agent_data.db`) is created automatically on first run
- If you encounter database errors, you can delete `agent_data.db` to start fresh
- Your meal plan history will be lost if you delete the database
